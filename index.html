<p>Hi! I'm Steve Longoria, thanks for visiting my site! I first became interested in computers when my step-father got me a Commodore 64 in the early 90s. Fast forward to the late 90s when we got our first family desktop computer that was connected to the great World Wide Web! I think our ISP was NetZero. :)</p>
<center><img style="border-radius:8px;margin-top:30px;margin-bottom:30px;" src="images/steve.jpeg"/></center>
<p>I eventually got around to creating my first website in my late teens and then quickly discovered blogging in my early 20s. The first blog I created was a music blog called RisingFist.com where I wrote about and filmed some of my favorite bands. I managed that blog for roughly 8 years before I put it down and moved on to other projects. At its peak, RisingFist.com was getting about 500 visitors a day. I didn't try too hard to monetize that blog as it was more of a labor of love.</p>
<p>That experience in blogging helped me land my first client. I helped drive traffic to his site, increase email sign ups and make more money in general from his site. From there I was hooked. I discovered I loved helping businesses succeed via the Internet.</p>
<p>Over the next several years I've helped several small to medium sized businesses with their digital marketing and lead generation. <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://blog.stevelongoria.net/2018/09/15/case-study-increased-agency-sales/">Check out this post</a> to see one of my most recent testimonials/case studies!</p>
<p>These days you'll find me working as a freelance digital marketing & sales consultant. <a href="https://blog.stevelongoria.net" target="_blank">I also blog</a> and <a href="https://stevelongoria.net/gadadvantage/" target="_blank">publish content in various formats</a>.  My favorite business books are <strong>Rework</strong>, <strong>Ogilvy On Advertising</strong> and <strong>Badass: Making Users Awesome</strong>, just to name a few.</p>
