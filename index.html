		<p style="min-width: 300px; max-width: 700px; text-align: justify;">I was born in the early 80s and first got into computers when my step-dad got me a Commodore 64 in the early 90s. He worked ad Xerox back then and was really into computers.

<p style="min-width: 300px; max-width: 700px; text-align: justify;">Fast forward to the late 90s when we got our first family desktop computer that was connected to the great World Wide Web! I think our ISP was NetZero. :)</p>
<p style="min-width: 300px; max-width: 700px; text-align: justify;">I eventually got around to creating my first website and then quickly discovered Wordpress in my early 20s.</p>
<p style="min-width: 300px; max-width: 700px; text-align: justify;">I created a blog on punk rock (risingfist.com) as that's what my main passion was in my 20s. I played drums in a handful of bands, filmed local bands, put out some cassette tapes, played some shows, and had a lot of fun.</p>
<p style="min-width: 300px; max-width: 700px; text-align: justify;">At it's peak I was getting about 500 visitors a day to that blog. I didn't really try to monetize that blog as I couldn't see myself putting up ads on that site. It was my sacred channel of sorts.</p>
<p style="min-width: 300px; max-width: 700px; text-align: justify;">That experience in blogging helped me land my first client that I helped drive traffic to his site, increase email sign ups and make more money in general from his site. From there I was hooked. I discovered I loved helping businesses succeed via the Internet.</p>
<p style="min-width: 300px; max-width: 700px; text-align: justify;">Over the next several years I've helped several small to medium sized businesses with their digital marketing and lead generation. You can see some of my most recent case studies just below.</p>
<p style="min-width: 300px; max-width: 700px; text-align: justify;">Fast forward to today and you'll find me working full-time at a digital marketing agency that shall rename nameless right now. I help them and their clients drive more traffic using Google Search Ads, increase their conversions via A/B Split-testing and increase sales on the 'backend' using email marketing and marketing automation.</p>
<p style="min-width: 300px; max-width: 700px; text-align: justify;">In the evenings I'm writing on Varpop.com (my coding blog) and blog.stevelongoria.net (my business & marketing blog).</p>
<p style="min-width: 300px; max-width: 700px; text-align: justify;">I try to spend a couple hours a week developing my coding chops. I really enjoy coding up my own landing pages and websites for projects I'm working on. Feel free to browse my Github linked above.</p>
<p style="min-width: 300px; max-width: 700px; text-align: justify;">I really enjoy photography and I'm always telling myself I'm going to get back into it. When I'm not working I enjoying riding my bicycle around town on a nice day, hike and I'm always down for a heated game of Chess or Scrabble. Simple pleasures make me happy! :)</p>

		<p style="min-width: 300px; max-width: 700px; text-align: justify;">I had been testing a few different ads for this particular client and this one ad has shown to have a 464% higher conversion rate than the other 2 ads. Obviously, I've paused the losing ads which is why they are greyed out in the screenshot. :)</p>

		<p style="min-width: 300px; max-width: 700px; text-align: justify;">I created the first successful Google Adwords lead generation campaign for small digital marketing agency located in San Diego. Their website was lucky to produce 1 lead every few months and in the span of 7 months I generated 64 leads from Adwords at an ever increasing rate, while driving cost per lead down.</p>
