	<div id="sales-letter">
		<p><strong>Let's face it, you&rsquo;re scared of ever touching Google Ads out of fear that you&rsquo;ll just bleed money.</strong> You're worried you'll end up over paying for clicks without anything to show for it. You're completely lost when it comes to keywords and how to manage negative keywords.</p>
		<p>Hell, you're aren't even quite sure what negative keywords are or what the difference is between modified broad match and phrase match. Then there's the whole 'conversion tracking' ordeal that has you pulling your hair out. How are you supposed to properly track your return on investment? How do you improve your return on investment over time?</p>
		<p> It's all just too complex and you have so many choices to make even before getting your first click from the campaign. And if you don&rsquo;t set up your campaign quite right, it could easily cost you thousands of dollars (or more) over time.</p>
<p>I remember clear as day how intimidated I used to be from Google Ads before learning it&rsquo;s quirks and inner-workings. Of course, back then it was called Adwords but it&rsquo;s all the same beast today just with a new slick user-interface that many are actually struggling to navigate.</p>
<h2>There was just so much contradicting information on the internet that I felt completely lost and helpless.</h2>
<p>You probably have the same exact feeling in your gut right now as I did. Completely paralyzed out of fear of losing money. You know it&rsquo;s possible to leverage Google Ads to grow your business wildly, but you don&rsquo;t know where to start or who to trust!</p>
<p>I was in your exact shoes until I decided to learn it the hard way, by blowing a bunch of my money on Google Ads. Trial and error baby! Fortunately, you won't have to do that as I'm about to show you what I learned!</p>
<p>What if you knew exactly how to setup and optimize a Google Search Ad campaign to maximize profits? Imagine knowing exactly how to turn a poor performing Google Ad campaign around and make it profitable again.</p>
<p><strong>Imagine Having A 5 Year Google Ad Veteran Show You Step-By-Step How To Kill It With Google Ads!</strong></p>
<p>What if you could finally start sending laser targeted Google traffic to your website starting tomorrow and feel confident that you know how to generate a steady flow of fresh, new customers? Imagine having the power to finally leverage Google Ads to grow you and your client&rsquo;s business.</p>
<h2>Manage Google Ad Campaigns Like A Pro With <strong>Google Ad Advantage</strong></h2>
<p>You&rsquo;ll learn how to identify exactly which ads, keywords, locations, time of day, day of week and device are generating the best return on investment for your business. This is POWERFUL data that allows you to maximize your profits.</p>
<h3>Finally, take control of your Google traffic with confidence and laser targeted precision starting today!</h3>
<p>I bottled all of my years of experience in generating thousands of dollars for my clients via Google Ads in ebook and you can pick it up today for the <em>super low price of $17</em>. That's right, for <u><strong>only a one-time investment of $17</strong></u>, you could soon be funneling laser targeted Google traffic directly to your product or service offer. Depending on what product or service you're offering, you can very quickly recoup your $17 investment, and then some.</p>
<p>I'm confident you'll do a lot better than that if you just follow the advice laid out in <strong>Google Ad Advantage</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><u>Don't wait! Take action today!</strong></u></p>

		<p style="margin-bottom:50px;margin-top:30px;" class="quote">"<em>Steve Longoria did achieve great results for our company at a very low cost per lead. We ran a campaign where we spent about $4,708.89 on Google Ads. On average, those new customers will stay on board for about a year. $700/mo is what we earn on average per customer. So if you do that math on that, that’s about $50k worth of income that we’re able to generate over the lifetime for those 6 customers that we brought on board since starting this campaign about 5 months ago. That’s a significant ROI. At least a 10x ROI. If you’re looking for somebody who can really set up a great campaign for you, I’d definitely look no further than Steve.</em>"

<div class="about-content">
<p>Hi, I'm Steve Longoria! I first became interested in computers when my step-father bought me a Commodore 64 in the early 90s. In the late 90's is when we bought our first desktop computer that was connected to the Internet! I think our ISP was NetZero. Needless to say, I was transfixed! :)</p>
<center><img style="border-radius:8px;margin-top:30px;margin-bottom:30px;" src="../images/steve.jpeg"/></center>
<p>I created my first static HTML website in my late teens and then quickly discovered blogging in my early 20s. The first blog I created was a music blog called RisingFist.com where I wrote about and filmed some of my favorite bands. I managed that blog for roughly 8 years before I put it down and moved on to other projects. At its peak, RisingFist.com was getting about 500 visitors a day. I didn't try too hard to monetize that blog as it was more of a labor of love.</p>
<p>That experience in blogging helped me land my first client. I helped drive traffic to his site, increase email sign ups and make more money in general from his site. From there I was hooked. I discovered I loved helping businesses succeed via the Internet.</p>
<p>Over the next several years I've helped several small to medium sized businesses with their digital marketing and lead generation. <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://blog.stevelongoria.net/2018/09/15/case-study-increased-agency-sales/">Check out this post</a> to see one of my most recent testimonials/case studies!</p>
<p>These days you'll find me working as a freelance business consultant. <a href="https://blog.stevelongoria.net" target="_blank">I also blog</a> and <a href="https://stevelongoria.net/gadadvantage/" target="_blank">publish content in various formats</a>.  My favorite business books are <strong>Rework</strong>, <strong>Ogilvy On Advertising</strong> and <strong>Badass: Making Users Awesome</strong>, just to name a few.</p>
