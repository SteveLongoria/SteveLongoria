		<p><strong>Let's face it, you&rsquo;re scared of ever touching Google Ads out of fear that you&rsquo;ll just bleed money.</strong> It's all just too complex and you have so many boxes to tick, options and choices to make even before getting your first click from the campaign.

<p>Let&rsquo;s be clear, if you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing with Google Ads you can lose a lot of money fast. Even if you do know what you&rsquo;re doing, every business and every campaign is slightly different which means it&rsquo;s not always a cake walk.</p>
