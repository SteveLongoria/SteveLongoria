        	<h2 class="text-center">This is probably the most common mistake made by small businesses!</h2>
<p>Every business owner has been told they need a website for a good 20 years now, so in 2018 they've most likely done one of the following (or all of the following):</p>
<div class="well row">
<div class="col-md-4">
<h2 class="text-center">Scenario #1</h2>
<p class="text-center">Use one of those popular website builder services with slick advertisements online and on TV.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<h2 class="text-center">Scenario #2</h2>
<p class="text-center">Hire a &lsquo;professional&rsquo; web designer to create a slick, modern looking website that would make mother say &ldquo;wowza!&rdquo;.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<h2 class="text-center">Scenario #3</h2>
<p class="text-center">Hire their nephew or niece who is learning web development to create a simple site for them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>After which, they neglect their website and either their business continues to succeed in spite of their website (not because of it) or they just go out of business because their competition knows how to market effectively online and therefore &lsquo;eats their lunch&rsquo;.</p>
<p>What they don&rsquo;t tell you is that the sales copy is absolutely crucial. It should be like a 3-part act, you start with the inciting incident, the pain your audience is experiencing. Then you move on to the dream, a hope for a better future. Then it&rsquo;s time to introduce the fix, the service or product that is going to bring about that better future.</p>
<p>This probably sounds familiar to you because it&rsquo;s one of the oldest story telling techniques known to man.&nbsp;<em>It has survived because it works at captivating an audience and getting their attention</em>!</p>
<p>Most small business websites just have the fix part of the sales copy, but imagine a movie that just had the ending, the resolution, how exciting would that be? Not very.</p>
<p><em>You&rsquo;re not going to make that mistake though!</em></p>
<p>Imagine if your website wasn&rsquo;t just a monthly cost you dreaded, but instead a valuable asset that your business can&rsquo;t do without. An asset that is insanely effective at converting interested parties into paying customers.</p>
<p>What if you had all your digital customer acquisition needs handled for you, so you can focus on what you do best fulfilling your service or product and making customers happy?</p>
<h2 class="text-center">Now You Can With My Digital Marketing Customer Acquisition Services</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been helping small businesses get more customers from their website for over 10 years and have increased sales and revenue by hundreds of thousands of dollars for my clients in this time. You can <a href="../index.html" target="_blank">learn more about me here.</a></p>
<p>This is where you&rsquo;re expecting me to list my $5k price tag, but that&rsquo;s not how my services work.</p>
<p>The way this works is that first you send me your logo, and the one product or service that accounts for the majority of your revenue. After which I will create custom sales copy and a custom website for your business that&rsquo;s designed to churn out customers like you&rsquo;ve never seen before. When I&rsquo;m finished, if you don&rsquo;t like it tell me to get lost and we&rsquo;ll part as friends.</p>
<p>You pay nothing, you&rsquo;ve risked nothing!</p>
<p>If you do however end up using my copy and website, it&rsquo;ll cost $100/mo for however long you&rsquo;d like to use it. This will include the hosting for the website.</p>
<p><strong><em>You can cancel anytime with just 30 days notice.</em></strong></p>
<p>Also, if we work together I&rsquo;ll guarantee not to work with any of your competition. So you&rsquo;ll have exclusive access to me for your given market and city. How&rsquo;s that for a competitive advantage? :)</p>
<p>If that all wasn&rsquo;t enough, I&rsquo;m going to also throw in a few bonuses!</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-3">
<h2 class="text-center">Bonus #1</h2>
<p class="text-center">I will setup Google Analytics so we can calculate your existing &lsquo;Revenue Per Visitor&rsquo; and watch as it goes up! Website traffic &amp; sales data is the information you use to make informed decisions and make your business more profitable over time.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-3">
<h2 class="text-center">Bonus #2</h2>
<p class="text-center">I will offer you first month of Google Adwords Ad Management for 50% off. After we get you set-up with a fresh new website with sizzling new copy, we&rsquo;re going to want to start driving more traffic to it. The fastest way to do this is with Google Adwords.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-3">
<h2 class="text-center">Bonus #3</h2>
<p class="text-center">I will setup private encrypted email from Protonmail.com for your business so you&rsquo;ll have&nbsp;</br><a href="mailto:yourname@yourbusiness.com">yourname@yourbusiness.com</a></p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-3">
<h2 class="text-center">Bonus #4</h2>
<p class="text-center">I will make your website secure with SSL certificates. As of July 2018, Google Chrome will start marking websites without SSL as unsecure, which will be bad for business to say the least.</p>
