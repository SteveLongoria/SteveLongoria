        	<p>You already know everybody is on Facebook but they have so many different ad types that...</p>
        	 <h2 class="text-center">You&rsquo;re Not Sure Which Ad Type Will Generate The Lowest Cost Per Lead For Your Property Management Company</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s also other variables you need to get just right in order to generate a low cost per lead like audience targeting, ad copy, ad image, etc.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why this case study I&rsquo;m about to show you is so important for your business. Learn from what has been proven to work for others in your industry. Don&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel!</p>
<p><strong>Using Facebook Lead Ads To Generate Property Management Leads For $9.70+</strong></p>
<p>In this case study I&rsquo;m going to show you how we&rsquo;ve generated property management leads for as low as $9.70 using Facebook Lead Ads specifically.</p>
<p>Facebook Lead Ads are one of the best Facebook ad types because it allows you to capture a lead directly on Facebook without the user every having to leave Facebook.</p>
<p>It will typically have higher conversion rates than sending visitors to a dedicated landing page on your website designed to capture the lead due to the Facebook Lead Ad form being auto populated with a users info like their name and email address. This is because Facebook already has that info so why make the user fill it in when Facebook can just automatically insert it.</p>
<p>The fewer the fields the user has to fill out in the form the higher the conversion rate will naturally be.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the ad that we&rsquo;ve used to generate leads as low as $8:</p>
<center><img class="img-responsive" src="images/fbleadad1.jpg"></center>
</br>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the form with dummy info but this is the info that is auto populated once users click the &ldquo;Sign Up&rdquo; button in the ad.</p>
<center><img class="img-responsive" src="images/fbleadad2.jpg"></center>
<p>Again the fewer fields the prospect has to fill out the higher your conversion rate will be.</p>
<h2 class="text-center">Audience Targeting</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;re probably thinking we do some fancy audience targeting and use custom audiences and lookalike audiences galore to generate the $9.70/lead. You&rsquo;re only partially right.</p>
<p>You might be surprised to find out that we&rsquo;ve gotten leads as low as $9.70/lead targeting only the city and ages 25+. Nothing fancy.</p>
<p>In some cities we have have noticed a lower cost per lead if you setup a 'Retargeting' campaign or use a more targeted audience based on income, homeownership, etc.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to experiment in this area to see what works best in your city.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not enough to review this case study and file it away for a rainy day. Go set a task or remind yourself via calendar, however you want to do it.</p>
