		<p>You need a professional to manage your Google Ad Campaign but you know you don&rsquo;t want to work with an agency. With an agency, you&rsquo;re just one client out of many. How can they truly spend the time needed to make your campaign a success?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re afraid your campaign won&rsquo;t get the special attention it deserves with an agency. You know their employees are spread thin with a large workload. Are they truly committed to delivering a profitable campaign for you or are they just trying to &lsquo;churn&rsquo; out the work as quickly as possible?</p>
<p>Generating a positive return on investment with Google Ads takes a lot of focus and concentration. A lot of time! Your work is never truly done either as there&rsquo;s always something you can optimize to increase your ROI over time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shouldn&rsquo;t you hire somebody that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is 100% dedicated to the success of your campaign?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Takes full ownership of the campaign and doesn&rsquo;t &lsquo;pass the buck&rsquo; onto a colleague?&nbsp;</li>
<li>Takes on only a small handful of clients in order to keep their quality of work high?&nbsp;</li>
<li>Knows what it takes to create a profitable Google Ad campaign?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&rsquo;re paying top dollar, you should receive top dollar service right? Now you can!</p>

<h1 style="margin-top:60px;">FAQ</h1>
<p><strong>Will you write new Google Ad copy every month?</strong></p>
<p>Coming up with ad copy and offers is a collaborative process that involves you (the client) and myself. I keep the focus on the campaign's key performance indicators (KPI's) and overall return on investment. I do whatever it takes to hit the campaign's KPI goals. I can&rsquo;t guarantee X new ads or landing pages per month as it is a creative process and some ads need time to be fully tested. When I see opportunities to increase your conversion rate by testing out new ad copy and landing page designs, we will do just that.</p>
<p><strong>Do you charge a percentage of my monthly ad spend?</strong></p>
<p>Nope, my prices are fixed so you can scale a successful campaign without having to worry about paying me more money every month.</p>
<p><strong>Do you charge a set up fee?</strong></p>
<p>Nope, you simply pay for your first month of service and I include the set up of your Google Ad campaign as well as landing page development and sales copywriting if you choose the more premium packages.</p>
<p><strong>Can I cancel at anytime?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, this service is month-to-month. There are no long-term contracts involved so you can cancel at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Do you perform the work on my Google Ad account?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I believe you should get to keep the work you pay me to do. This means that I build your Google Ad campaign using your Google Ad Account, not mine. If we ever part ways, you get to keep the work I did.</p>

		<p style="margin-bottom:50px;" class="quote">"<em>Steve Longoria did achieve great results for our company at a very low cost per lead. We ran a campaign where we spent about $4,708.89 on Google Ads. On average, those new customers will stay on board for about a year. $700/mo is what we earn on average per customer. So if you do that math on that, that’s about $50k worth of income that we’re able to generate over the lifetime for those 6 customers that we brought on board since starting this campaign about 5 months ago. That’s a significant ROI. At least a 10x ROI. If you’re looking for somebody who can really set up a great campaign for you, I’d definitely look no further than Steve.</em>"
