		<p>I was born in '83 and first got into computers when my step-dad got me a Commodore 64 in the early 90s. He worked at Xerox back then and was really into computers.</p>

<p>Fast forward to the late 90s when we got our first family desktop computer that was connected to the great World Wide Web! I think our ISP was NetZero. :)</p>
<p>I eventually got around to creating my first website and then quickly discovered Wordpress in my early 20s (I've since moved on to Hexo and Ghost for blogging however).</p>
<p>I created a music blog called RisingFist.com where I wrote about and filmed some of my favorite bands. I managed that blog for roughly 8 years before I put it down and moved on to other projects.</p>
<p>At its peak RisingFist.com was getting about 500 visitors a day. I didn't try to monetize that blog as I couldn't see myself putting up ads on that site. It was my sacred channel of sorts.</p>
<p>That experience in blogging helped me land my first client. I helped drive traffic to his site, increase email sign ups and make more money in general from his site. From there I was hooked. I discovered I loved helping businesses succeed via the Internet.</p>
<p>Over the next several years I've helped several small to medium sized businesses with their digital marketing and lead generation. <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://blog.stevelongoria.net/2018/09/15/case-study-increased-agency-sales/">Check out this post</a> to see one of my most recent testimonials/case studies!</p>
<p>Fast forward to today and you'll find me working as a freelance digital marketing & sales consultant. My favorite business books are <strong>Rework</strong>, <strong>Ogilvy On Advertising</strong> and <strong>Badass: Making Users Awesome</strong>, just to name a few.</p>
<p>In the evenings I'm writing on my personal business & marketing blog <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://blog.stevelongoria.net" target="_blank">here</a> and developing new products.</p>
<p>I try to spend a couple hours a week developing my coding chops. I really enjoy coding up my own landing pages and websites for projects I'm working on.
